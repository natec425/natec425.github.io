  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this week is going to be super short. I finished a first pass at getting a (possibly bad) AI to auto play the game. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m still enjoying Elm a lot. I feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t have to dread the browser anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id="super-simple-ai"&gt;Super Simple AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go forth and earn me unusable points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="voltorb-flip"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="/js/voltorb-flip-3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var node = document.getElementById('voltorb-flip');
var app = Elm.AI.Main.embed(node);&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the AI has uses some notion of expected points per cell. For example, a cell that must be either a 2 or a 3 should have an expected value of 2.5 The just exposes the cell with the highest expected points until it wins or loses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="elm-has-been-great"&gt;Elm has been great&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the project is about 500 lines of elm, and it has been a pleasure. It has been surprisingly pleasant to add or change features. I would be interested to see what this project would look like if it were implemented using javascript/typescript/coffeescript/etc. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if my implementation would be or worse. In fact, I would bet mine would be worse in some ways. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if my implementation was more correct or maintainable. Elm can take a good bit of credit for helping with that. But my use of non-Elm web tech should probably be pretty poor. Also, my use of Elm should probably be pretty poor (less than 1 month of experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/natec425/Voltorb-Flip"&gt;up on github&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to disapprove of the lack of documentation or tests. I approve of your disapproval and hope to fix it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, at least I don&amp;rsquo;t hate the browser anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="next-week"&gt;Next Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student at Base Camp keeps asking me to make a learning AI. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll make another bad AI, but this time&amp;hellip; it will learn. No click bait deep learning. Just regular old vanilla reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry></feed>
